# Practical Lab 1 – Univariate Linear Regression  
**Student Name:** Preetpal Singh  
**Student ID:** 8804336  

## 📘 Description
This project demonstrates a univariate linear regression analysis on the California Housing Prices dataset. The goal is to understand the linear relationship between median house value and three independent variables:
- Median income
- Population
- Number of households

The analysis follows the standard machine learning workflow: framing the problem, exploring the data, fitting models, evaluating them, and drawing conclusions.

## 📊 Project Structure
- `Untitled-1.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, visualizations, and analysis.
- `README.md` – This file.


## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Models Trained
Three univariate linear regression models:
1. Median House Value vs. Median Income
2. Median House Value vs. Population
3. Median House Value vs. Number of Households


## ✅ Results Summary
- The model with **Median Income** as the independent variable provided the best fit.
- Visualizations and error metrics are included in the notebook for comparison.
